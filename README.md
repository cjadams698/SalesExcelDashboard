# SalesExcelDashboard
A dashboard made in excel looking at sales through age group, gender, channel, and location. The SalesReportRawData.xlsx is the spreadsheet and data that I started with. The SalesReportDashboardFinal.xlsx is the end result of my project. 

Insights:
Women are much more likely to buy than men (~65%).
The top three locations make up about a third of our total sales (~35%) and should be prioritized.
~71% of sales come from adult age group (22-50) and should be targeted.
Should focus ads and promotion on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra as these are the channels that contribute the most.
